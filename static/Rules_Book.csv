The Game,,Checks,"Play proceeds as players and the DM describe.
When there is uncertainty and something at stake , roll [attribute] d6s. Add or subtract dice from the pool as the situation dictates. If a character has relevant tools, they get an extra die. If they are in a hurry, they lose one.  Establish the pool size before any dice hit the table.
6s are successes. 1s are complications.
If a roll  is directly opposed, each side rolls and the side with more successes wins.
If half the dice pool is complications,  a fumble occurs."
The Game,,Saving Throws,"Saving Throws are just like every other check, except the DC is 20."
The Game,,Helping,"Anytime another player foregoes an action in order to assist you, you have Help. Help is a +2 bonus. You may only benefit from help once per roll. "
The Character,Creating a Charatcer,,- Generate attribute scores by rolling 2d6 and taking the average (round up) for each attribute.
The Character,Creating a Charatcer,,- Choose two skills. Characters with an intelligence of 3 or more gain an additional skill. all skills start at rank 1.
The Character,Creating a Charatcer,,- Starting characters are broke. Roll 2d6 for starting silver (s).
The Character,Attributes,Strength,"This is a measure of your physical strength. A higher strength helps you lift heavier objects, bend bars, and force open doors. Your roll this for attacks with most melee weapons and it impacts how much you can carry."
The Character,Attributes,Dexterity,This is a reflection of your physical agility and hand-eye coordination. Your Dexterity can affect your ability to Defend yourself and execute skills that require fine motor control or quick reactions. You roll this for attacks with most ranged weapons.
The Character,Attributes,Constitution,"This is a reflection of your  total body health and stamina. You roll health checks to resist exhaustion, diseases, and poisons, and to stay in the fight once your hit protection is gone."
The Character,Attributes,Intelligence,This is a measure of how readily you acquire and connect knowledge. The DM might occasionally ask you to roll this for extra bits of information. You have a number of Skill Slots equal to your Intelligence. A high Intelligence also helps you raise Skills more reliably.
The Character,Attributes,Wisdom,"This is a measure of your instincts and strength of spirit. Your Initiative is equal to your Wisdom. You'll roll Initiative during combat to see if you act before or after your opponent, and to resist magical and mundane effects that might fool your senses or your mind. This is also the stat for trying to hide or disappear into crowds."
The Character,Attributes,Charisma,"This is a measure of your strength of personality and connection to fate. Your Charisma is often used for saves against strange magic. You'll also make Charisma checks when trying to appeal to NPCs when the outcome of roleplaying is uncertain."
The Character,Skills,What are skills?,"Skills are keywords that represent areas of expertise that your character has developed throughout their life, whether that be a hobby, a failed career, or just something the character spent a lot of time around as a child. Each skill has a score between 1 and 3"
The Character,Skills,Using Skills,"If your character has a skill, they can do that thing without a roll as long as circumstances permit. Carpenters can make chairs. Bakers can make bread. Orators can write speeches. Additionally, whenever there is a relevant connection between a skill and a roll, the character gets a +1 bonus."
The Character,Skills,Example Skills,"Skills are lifestyles, hobbies, professions, or crafts. Good skills are things like: Scribe, Soldier, Farmer, Baker, Carpenter, Librarian, Local Street Rat, Drunk Bastard. Skills are not directly useful in combat. Be creative in how you apply skills. "
The Character,Skills,Mastering a Skill,"Upon reaching level 6 your character may attempt to master one skill. During downtime after reaching level 6, choose one skill and make an intelligence check for your character. If it succeeds they're now a master. If it fails you may make the check again at the next level. Increase the skill to rank 4. Additionally, you and the DM should work together to come up with a unique feature related to the skill to add to the character's Legend. "
The Character,Skills,Languages,"All PCs speak Vulgar Common.  None speak any other language. It is generally assumed that most everyone in the land can speak to and understand the players. Otherwise, languages are a type of skill that costs skill slots and must be acquired like all other skills. It may be the case that artifacts, spirits, foreigners, and dead folks speak other languages. That's what language skills are for."
The Character,Skills,Mastering a Language,"Most languages have special features if you Master them. For example:
Elvish – Encryption. You cannot be understood by anyone except the people you designate (who also speak Elvish).
Dwarvish – Axiomatic. Speaking it functions as a calm emotions spell cast on the self."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,,"A level zero character is nothing but a possibility, a nobody who could be somebody. After that you can think of the base adventurer as Indiana Jones minus the Archaeologist (unless the character is an archaeologist, of course) or as Conan, the Grey Mouser, Buck Rodgers or whatever appendix N hero is your personal favorite. At level 1 they're a capable adventurer, a cut above the rest. This is what your character looks like at each level without class templates."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Levels,"A measure of your character's power and prestige. It goes up as you gain experience. At level 4 a character has access to all of their abilities, and is considered “fully grown”. Abilities a character gains beyond this point are the result of questing, not merely leveling up. If you want fireball, you'll have to quest for it."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,HP,"Hit Points are better thought of as hit protection. They represent your ability to survive blows that are potentially traumatic or lethal through luck, skill, or toughness. When your HP runs out, you've run out of luck and stamina and any blow is a potentially lethal one. Your HP cannot go below 0. However, any blow after this is potentially lethal and likely to result in a serious injury."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Class Templates,"Templates are class abilities applied on top of the base adventurer. There are four templates for each Class, labeled A through D. You gain these in the listed order: you cannot gain Fighter B unless you have Fighter A. If you want to multi-class, just take a template from a different Class. You get one template per level. You cannot have more than 4 templates."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Attack,You add your attack bonus to rolls whenever you try to hit something. A 0-level character has an attack attribute of 0.
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Fate,"Fate reflects the ability of legendary adventurers to command a modicum of respect from the universe. It is only accessible to characters above level 4. Whenever an unfortunate roll of the dice occurs, a character with Fate points may spend one to twist fate and avert the roll, substituting it for a second one. A character may do this a number of times equal to their Fate points.
Defying fate doesn't come for free however. At an appropriate moment the DM may choose to return fate to normal and re-impose that unfortunate roll on the player. After the consequences resolve and a long rest re-imposed fate points return to the player to be spent again."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Legend,Every adventurer builds a legend around themselves. It just comes with the job. The legend is a record of your character’s biggest feats and accomplishments. It’s also where you will record extra features your character gains from questing.
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Hires,The Hires attribute represents the maximum number of hirelings a character to can reasonably retain under their direct command at any time.
The Character,The Base Adventurer,XP,"You gain 1 XP for every gold(s) you obtain through adventurous means. When you’ve amassed the amount of experience listed for your current level, it’s time to level up."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Money,"- Characters are assumed to be carrying enough coin to buy acceptable food, drink, and lodging unless they're impoverished.
- 100 copper cuprek = 10 silver shilavos = 1 golden gorbel."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Conviction,"Not everyone has Convictions, but adventurers always do. Adventuring is desperate, deadly work and no one engages in it without a good reason. A Conviction is your character's answer to one of these questions:
- Why did I start adventuring? 
- What am I willing to risk my life for? 
- What principles do I use to guide my actions?
Choose two convictions for your character whenever you want. A Conviction might be “Seek knowledge.” Or “Help the innocent.” Or “Money is power.” Or even “Hello, ladies.” These are morals, instincts, or bonds. You gain a point of Conviction when following your conviction gets you into trouble or gains you nothing. You may then spend your Conviction to get a bonus to a roll. If the roll is related to a Conviction add 2. If the roll is not related to a Conviction add 1.  You cannot have more than 1 point of Conviction at a time.
A character who loses a conviction, either by fulfilling it or having an experience which causes them to abandon it, has something added to their Legend and may choose a new conviction at any time."
The Character,The Base Adventurer,Movement,"Your Movement is equal to 5 - Encumbrance + any Movement bonuses you may have. It’s mostly to determine how far you can move, but is also used for chases and such.  A party moves at the speed of its slowest character."
The Character,Leveling Up,Gain a new Template,"When you level up, you gain a new template and all of the perks listed in the base adventurer table. You can also test a stat of your choice to see if it improves."
The Character,Leveling Up,Improving a Stat,"To test a stat, roll 2d4. If the result is equal-or-higher than the stat you are trying to improve, that stat improves by 1. Alternatively, you may test to increase your HP; roll 1d6 if it is greater than your previous roll, increase your HP by 1."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Time,"The DM will need to keep track of time. Time controls how fast your torches burn down, and how often you roll for random encounters. You cannot have a meaningful campaign if strict time measures are not kept.
Exploration turns take 10 minutes. Dungeoneering actions usually take 1 exploration turn. This may seem slow because the party is moving at ""dungeon speed"". Everyone is tip-toeing, talking in a whisper, noticing all the details of the rooms they are in, and feeling out every step they take. Examples of dungeoneering actions include: Searching a room or body. Prying a torch sconce off the wall. Passing through a room for the first time."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Investigation,"A player specifically says  that they want to closely examine a particular feature, or interact with a certain object (e.g. open a drawer.) It usually takes a negligible amount of time."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Searching,The party spends 10 minutes examining a room more closely (e.g. sifting through a bone pile). Anything that can be found through Investigation can also be found through searching.
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Noise,"Whenever something makes Noise, the DM will roll for a random encounter. In general, there is a 2-in-6 chance of something hearing the noise and arriving in 1d6 rounds"
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Light,"Torches illuminate 30' and go out after they are depleted twice. Dropped torches can be picked up.
Oil flasks illuminate 30' and go out after they are depleted twice. If you drop (or throw) an oil lamp, it creates a 10' wide pool of fire that burns for 3 rounds, and deals 1d6 damage per round to everything that remains in contact with it.
Candles illuminate 10' and last all day.
Torches and lanterns deplete during Encounter Checks, but only the Encounter checks that occur every 30 minutes, not the ones that occur as a result of noise. Light sources are extinguished if you fall in water. "
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Map,"Map squares are 10' across. The DM will describe the dungeon, and the players should map it themselves. This is a core part of the game experience. Mapping the dungeon helps you figure out where monsters might be, and where hidden rooms and treasures might lie."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Doors,"It is always assumed that characters listen at doors before they open them, because they are going at dungeon speed, and they aren't idiots. If there is something behind the door that is making noise, the DM will tell you.
Wooden doors can be kicked in, but it makes Noise. If the kicker succeeds on a Str check, they can do it in a negligible amount of time. Otherwise it takes 10 minutes. 
Metal doors cannot be kicked in. Locked doors can be opened if you have the appropriate key. Locked doors can also be picked if you have a set of lockpicks and a successful Locksmith roll (or whatever). 
Portcullises have gaps large enough for your fist, but not larger. There is often a ratchet-style winch nearby that can raise the portcullis. By default, a portcullis is typically  locked in the lowered position (no amount of Str can raise it), but they can also be locked in the open position.  It takes 1 minute to raise a portcullis, and 1 second to drop it. 
Barred doors can only be opened on the side where it is barred. Each “bar” is a piece of lumber that weighs 100+ lbs. Moving one by yourself requires a Str check."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Food and Water,"After 1 day without water, a character becomes dehydrated, and gets a -3 penalty to all rolls. After 3 days without water, they will die. Each day without any food causes max HP to reduce by 1 (down to 0). Death takes weeks."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Cooking,"Cooking a decent meal takes at least 30 minutes, at least an hour if the meat has to be butchered first. The smell of cooking food attracts the attention of any nearby monsters. Roll all wandering monster checks twice."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Poison,"A poison always has a damage listed after it in parentheses, such as “adder venom (1d6)”. When you are exposed to poison, you take the poison damage at the end of your next round. The round after that, you must make a Con check. If you succeed, you take no further damage. If you fail, you take the listed damage again, and again the following turn.
Basically you take the damage 1x on a successful Con check, and 3x spread out over three turns on a failed Con check. Slower poisons have their intervals listed after the damage, such as “strychnine (2d6, minutes)”. The default is rounds. Poisoned weapons only discharge their poison once, on a successful hit, and then the poison must be reapplied. Most creatures are immune to their own poison."
Exploration,Exploring Dungeons,Traps,"It takes 10 minutes to manufacture and set a trap in natural terrain. If they carried they take up 1 Inventory Slot.
Enemies that walk into a trap must make a DEX Save or suffer its effects.
You can choose a reasonable effect, such as: 1d6 damage, an immobilizing snare, or noisemakers. 
You can add additional effects, but each one beyond the first gives your target a +2 bonus on their Dexterity check."
Exploration,Inventory and Encumberance,Inventory,"PCs have a number of Inventory Slots equal to their Strength + 6 (on account of having a pack). One inventory slot can contain 3 small items or 1 medium-sized item. Large items take 2 slots.
Only items carried take up inventory. Horses, hirelings, and carts do not count. 
Clothing, jewelry, and other cosmetic items do not take up inventory unless they are bulky or fragile.
Negligible items (small enough to fit in your closed mouth), including gems and gold, do not take up inventory unless stipulated by the DM."
Exploration,Inventory and Encumberance,Inventory Examples,"Examples of what fits in a single inventory slot:
• 3 Light Weapons (daggers)
• 3 Bottles or Flasks
• 3 Books
• 3 Rations
• 1 Medium Weapon (a sword or a bow)
• 1 Lantern
• 1 Torch
• 0.5 Large Weapons (a maul takes 2 slots)"
Exploration,Inventory and Encumberance,At-Hand Items,Players may designate any 2 items to be 'at-hand'. These can be accessed immediately at any time. It takes one round to retrieve any other item during combat.
Exploration,Stealth,What's the deal with Stealth?,"There is no Stealth skill in this game, nor is there a single check for the things that typically fall under stealth. Instead, stealth falls into two broad categories at DM discretion: Move Silently and Hide. Stealth checks should always be described in enough detail that everyone at the table knows what the relevant check is. Moreover, stealth only applies when success is ambiguous. Anyone can hide under a bed, and no one can walk directly in front of an alert guard without being seen."
Exploration,Stealth,Move Silently,"This is any time you're attempting to move unnoticed. If there is a guard on the lookout or someone is actively searching for you, make an opposed check. Otherwise, roll against 16 as normal. "
Exploration,Stealth,Hide,"This is any time you're attempting to go unnoticed in a situation where you could reasonably be seen--like getting lost in a crowd. This is less about moving nimbly, and more about being aware of the situation and the ways others think, as a result this is a Wisdom check and follows the same rules as moving silently."
Exploration,Random Encounters,What is a Randome Encounter?,"Every 30 minutes of in-game time spent crawling dungeons, traveling lonely roads, or wandering the wilderness, the DM will call for a random encounter. The random encounter roll consists of 2d6, 1 for the type of encounter, and one for recon/ambush."
Exploration,Random Encounters,The Encounter Die,"The Encounter Die is a d6. Your type of encounter is based on what it shows.
1 Active Encounter
2 Passive Encounter
3 Indirect Encounter
4-6 Nothing
An Active Encounter is one that forces the party to engage. In a dungeon, this is usually a hostile creature that wants to kill you. A Passive Encounter is one that gives you the option of engaging. In a dungeon, this is usually a non-hostile creature, or a hostile creature that isn't immediately threatening. An Indirect Encounter is one that you can't directly engage with. You might still be able to gain information from it, or it might just show you the mood of the location."
Exploration,Random Encounters,The Recon Die,"The Recon Die is a d6. If you roll a 1 on your Recon Die then you get a special advantage.
If your Recon succeeds on an Active or Passive Encounter, you gain Surprise. You can choose to engage (with the element of surprise) or avoid the encounter altogether. You might catch them talking to themselves and overhear something useful (DM's discretion).
If your Recon succeeds and there is no Active or Passive Encounter to be had, you find Footprints. These don't have to be literal footprints--they could be slime, hair, feces, graffiti, smells, or noises.  You find traces of a random encounter. Your DM will roll out choose an encounter  and describe the evidence of its passing.
If your only illumination is candle-light, you lose your Recon Die and instead gain an Ambush Die, which causes you to be surprised on a 1. If you have no light source, you are ambushed on 1-2."
Combat,Defending,Defense and Armor,"Your defense acts as a target number whenever someone tries to attack you. Wearing more grants a higher base defense but reduces armor benefits from dexterity. Heavier armors come with additional penalties shown below.
No Armor: Dexterity.
Light Armor: 3 + 2/3 Dexterity.
Medium Armor: 5 + 1/3 Dexterity.
Medium armor also imposes 1 point of encumbrance, and the wearer must make a Strength check to swim.
Heavy Armor: 7 Defense.
Heavy armor also imposes 3 points of encumbrance, and the wearer cannot swim."
Combat,Defending,Shields,"A held shield provides +1 Defense and occupies 2 inventory slots. Additionally, you can choose to sunder your shield to reduce incoming physical damage by 2d6 points."
Combat,Attacking,Melee Weapons,"Light weapons like daggers deal [net successes] damage. They can be thrown, but attack rolls incur a -1 penalty beyond 10' and -3 beyond 30'. They suffer no penalties when fighting in a confined space and can be readily hidden.
Medium weapons like swords and axes take up a single Inventory Slot and deal 1d6 + [net successes] damage, or 1d6 + [2x net successes] damage if wielded with two hands. They're impossible to hide and difficult to wield in confined space.
Heavy weapons like greatswords take up two Inventory Slots and deal 2d6 + [2x net successes] damage, but have a -1 attack penalty and must be wielded with two hands. They're ioncredibly heavy, impossible to hide and impossible to wield in confined space, They impose one additional point of encumbrance and weak characters may suffer further penalties."
Combat,Attacking,Dual-Wielding,"If you attack while dual-wielding, you get +1 to hit. Only one weapon actually does damage."
Combat,Attacking,Ranged Weapons,"Both bows and crossbows shoot arrows. You can fit 20 arrows in an Inventory Slot with the weapon. If you recover spent arrows after combat, 50% of them will be usable. Possession of a crossbow is usually a crime.
Slings deal [net successes] damage. They get -1 penalty to attack rolls between 20' and 60' away, and -3 beyond that, out to 120'. A sling can share an Inventory Slot with up to 3 stones. Stones can always be gathered with a few minutes of searching.
Bows deal 1d6 + [net successes] damage. The optimal range for a bow is between 90' and 180'. As such they get a -1 penalty to attack rolls between 30' and 90' away as well as between 180' and 270', they have a -3 penalty outside of those ranges.
Crossbows deal 1d6 + [net successes] damage and attack rolls get -1 penalty beyond 40'. Beyond 120' they are generally ineffective. It is a standard action to reload a crossbow."
Combat,Attacking,Unusual Ranged Weapons,"Firearms and laser weapons have variable capacity and their ammunition cannot be recovered. When their capacity is expended they must be reloaded/recharged.
Firearms deal 2d6 + [net successes] damage unless specified otherwise.
Laser weapons and modern firearms also deal 2d6 + [net successes] damage, but are always assumed to have a unique +2 attack bonus as if they were unique magic weapons."
Combat,Attacking,Unarmed Attacks and Improvised Weapons,"Unarmed Attack and Improvised Weapons
Unarmed attacks deal 1d4 damage.
Improvised weapons have a -1 attack penalty and deal 1d6 damage."
Combat,Misc.,Initiative,"You have a bonus to Initiative equal to your Wisdom. You roll it at the beginning of each combat. If you succeed, you act before the enemies. If you fail, you act after them."
Combat,Misc.,Breakage,"When a weapon gets its first break, reduce its die size. When it gets its second break, it's useless and must be replaced or reforged. For each break in Armor reduce its Def by 2. When it's Def reaches 0, it's useless and must be replaced. Masterwork weapons need to be broken twice before reducing the die size. Only magical foes can break magical arms and armor."
Combat,Misc.,Crits and Fumbles,"Fumbled Defense: the target's armor breaks if they're wearing any, and they make a Trauma save. On a fail, they take a wound. On a success, roll damage as normal.
Fumbled Attack: the attacker's weapon breaks, and an enemy adjacent to the attacker gets a free attack or combat maneuver."
Combat,Misc.,Collisions,"If terrain impedes sudden forced movement, the target (and the terrain if applicable) take 1d4 damage for every 5' of movement negated up to a maximum of 3d4.
If a creature impedes sudden forced movement, the creature may use its reaction to make a DC10 dexterity save to avoid the collision and move 5' to the nearest legal square. On a failed save or no reaction both are knocked prone and treated as if squeezed in the square until they disentangle from each other."
Combat,Misc.,Combat Maneuvers,"Shove, trip, disarm, disengage, push passed, grapple, that sort of thing.
To make a combat maneuver, make an opposed ability score check in place of an attack. If you succeed, the maneuver occurs. You roll STR for shoving and grappling. You roll DEX for everything else. Your target rolls either STR or DEX, whichever is better as long as it makes sense."
Damage and Defeat,,Wounds,"Whenever you take damage after dropping to 0 HP make a constitution save. If you fail the save, take the appropriate Wound from the Wounds table below. Some damage may be more mental or magical than physical. In these situations the DM should adjust the save as appropriate.
Look  up the damage taken on the wounds table to find the corresponding wound. Wounds are a big part of an adventurer’s story and you’re encouraged to keep a log of each one you gain."
Damage and Defeat,,Recovering HP,"You can recover hit points in 3 ways.
• A good night's rest restores all HP, as long as you have a campfire and a blanket. Lacking those things, it restores 1d4 HP.
• A good long lunch restores 1d6HP, as long as you have food and water. This takes an hour and must involve little more than relaxing and eating."
Damage and Defeat,,Healing,"Unless tended to by magic, healing wounds takes more time.  A player may remove one wound from a character for each downtime phase between adventures and another for each adventure a character sits out."
Damage and Defeat,,Retirement,"If your character ever acquires more wounds than their level they’re forced into early retirement at the end of their current adventure. Either their body can't take it, or they've lost the spirit. Give your character a fitting exit and roll another."
Companions,Hirelings,What are Hirelings?,"Hirelings are NPC allies. Most work for a fee, such as a half-share of any treasure discovered. They start with a random personality, random goals, and a Morale of 13. "
Companions,Hirelings,Henchmen,"Henchmen can be hired for 1s/day, or half a share of loot (whichever is higher). Henchmen have 10 inventory slots and will happily hold torches for you. Henchmen will accompany you throughout the dungeon, but they will not take risks for you. They will not fight."
Companions,Hirelings,Mercenaries,"Mercenaries can be hired for 10s/day, or a full share of loot (whichever is higher). Each mercenary will stick close to their employer. Mercenaries will take risks, including combat, as long as they aren't being asked to take more risks than everyone else. All mercenaries that you'll hire at the local tavern are level 1 fighters by default, but you may have opportunities to hire other mercenaries that you meet in your journeys.
In combat, Mercenaries don't take turns the way that most characters do. Instead, they give their adjacent employer +2 Attack and +2 Damage. If the employer would take lethal damage from a physical attack, there is a 50% chance that their hired mercenary is killed instead. Every mercenary beyond the first gives only +1 Attack."
Companions,Hirelings,Loyalty,"Each Hireling has a Loyalty score, which starts at 4 by default. Whenever you ask a hireling to perform a dangerous task outside of their job description, you must make a Charisma check to see if they are willing. The DC for this check is 20 - Loyalty.
If a hireling is treated well (extra money, extra safety, respectful treatment), their loyalty will increase by 1 or 2 points. Mistreating a hireling causes Loyalty to fall by 1, 1d4, or 1d6. Asking a hireling to do a dangerous task outside of their job description always causes Loyalty to fall by 1, regardless of whether or not they accept. If Loyalty ever reaches 0, the hireling will leave at the earliest opportunity."
Companions,Pets,,"Pets are trained animals. They don't expect any treasure and they don't get a share of XP. They must be commanded to do things. Even war dogs will not enter combat until you command them to. Commanding a pet is a standard action. Unless they were raised and trained together, you can expect your pets to fight and even kill each other."
Conditions,,Befuddled,"Befuddled creatures cannot tell any two creatures apart—everyone looks the same to them.  Whenever they attack, they attack a random creature.  When a Befuddled creature casts a spell, they cast a random spell at a target picked randomly from all eligible ones.  Whenever they try to run through a door, they run through a random door.  The DM should feel free to dictate additional effects as necessary."
Conditions,,Fear,"If a Player Character is Afraid of something, they lose 1d6 HP when they approach or attack the object of their Fear (max 1/round).  If this reduces them to 0 HP and they don't faint, they flee and hide uncontrollably for the next 10 minutes.
There are two ways for Player Characters to reduce the duration of Fear:
If you are safe (not threatened, out of sight), you can spend a standard action reducing the duration of the fear by 1d6 rounds.
If you damage the object of your Rear, the Fear is immediately dispelled.
If an NPC is Afraid of something, it will try to run away.  If left to its own devices, it will hide in the adjacent room/area that is most safe and return to combat when the duration is up.  NPCs resist Fear with a morale check, made as a group."
Conditions,,Deprived,A character lacking some essential need or with an immediate problem that must be addressed is Deprived. Deprived characters cannot benefit from rests or lunches (unless the thing they’re deprived of is rest or food respectively).
Conditions,,Drunkeness,Each point of drunkenness expands your critical fail/miss range by 1. So a character with 3 points of drunkenness would critically miss on a roll of 1-3. This lasts until the next morning.
