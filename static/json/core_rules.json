Whenever you ask a hireling to perform a dangerous task outside of their job description, you must make a Charisma check to see if they are willing. The DC for this check is 20 - Loyalty.\nIf a hireling is treated well (extra money, extra safety, respectful treatment), their loyalty will increase by 1 or 2 points. Mistreating a hireling causes Loyalty to fall by 1, 1d4, or 1d6. Asking a hireling to do a dangerous task outside of their job description always causes Loyalty to fall by 1, regardless of whether or not they accept. If Loyalty ever reaches 0, the hireling will leave at the earliest opportunity."}, "72": {"Section": "Companions", "Title": "Pets", "Subtitle": "", "Body": "Pets are trained animals. They don't expect any treasure and they don't get a share of XP. They must be commanded to do things. Even war dogs will not enter combat until you command them to.

If this reduces them to 0 HP and they don't faint, they flee and hide uncontrollably for the next 10 minutes.\nThere are two ways for Player Characters to reduce the duration of Fear:\nIf you are safe (not threatened, out of sight), you can spend a standard action reducing the duration of the fear by 1d6 rounds.\nIf you damage the object of your Rear, the Fear is immediately dispelled.\nIf an NPC is Afraid of something, it will try to run away.  If left to its own devices, it will hide in the adjacent room/area that is most safe and return to combat when the duration is up.
